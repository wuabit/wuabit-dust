## About
**Wuabit Dust** is a password/key usb generator **targeting to be the most affordable hardware based generator device in the world**, period.

It's using one of the most **tiny/cheapest** arduino boards: The open-source [Digispark board](https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark). You can find it for **less than 2â‚¬** on internet.

Here is a photo of the device:

## Features

* Plug-and-play: As it works as a standard USB keyboard
* Stores key/pass in internal [eeprom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM) memory with more than 100,000 cycles of writes assured.
* Uses the [ATtiny85](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85) microcontroller from [Atmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel) now [MicroChip](https://www.microchip.com), one of the most ubiquitous 8-bit mcu.

## How it works

**Wuabit Dust** generates keys/passwords by simply connecting it to a free USB port (works even in Android with USB-OTG).

## Versions:

* [vSHA-256](https://github.com/wuabit/wuabit-dust/tree/v1.0-arduino/wuabit-dust-sha256): v1.0 Generates **one single key** ([Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) based).
* [vSHA-256](wuabit-dust-sha256): Generates **many keys** ([PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) based).



## Security warning

This device generates a key in hardware, but writes it via usb-keyboard emulation, so if the target machine is compromised with a keylogger then the key can be stolen. The same if it's sent to a compromised/evil online service etc...
